                        <h3>Goodbye to John Hilton</h3>
                        <p>The Hoghton Players recently performed a concert version of ‘Iolanthe’ at Formby URC in aid of the Dove Trust.  Audience members included long-standing member and well-known local thespian, John Hilton, who will shortly be leaving Southport – his home of over 45 years for a new life in the Yorkshire Dales.</p> <p> John has starred in and directed any number of Hoghton productions over the years, his favourites being ‘Patience’ and ‘The Pirates of Penzance’.  Pictured is current Chairman Olwen Walsh making a presentation to John, along with a photograph of John and all members of the ‘Iolanthe’ cast.</p>
