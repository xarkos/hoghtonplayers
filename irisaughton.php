                 <h2>The Iris Aughton Memorial Bursary</h2>

                    <br>

                    <p>Iris Aughton, a much-loved long-standing member of the Society sadly died only weeks before our year 2000 production of "The Gondoliers". Iris was real 'mother' to all new and especially younger members of the Society. She was a great support and very enthusiastic about keeping G & S alive for future generations. The Committee therefore felt that it would be entirely suitable for Iris' memory and enthusiasm for life to be honoured by a special Bursary. To that end, the Society launched this new initiative in September 2001.</p>

                    <p>Applications for the Bursary are invited from those aged 18 - 25 years who are intending to devote a significant amount of their time (professional or semi-professional) to the performing arts. Applicants must have played an active part in any two main productions within a 4 year period; this can include technical work eg sound, stage managing, costumes, set design, as well as singing, acting, dancing. The Bursary award will be Â£500.</p>
